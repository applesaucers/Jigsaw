The Backstage Pass:
Jess is jealous when Megan's heroism nets her a day with the cast of Seinfeld, so she takes over Megan's mind and steals her body:
plot of episode- George is jealous when Kramer's philanthropy nets him tickets to a Fall Out Boy concert, George's favorite band.
Newman (or Elaine? What's she doing?) frames Jerry for murder.
George = Jess
Jerry = Kate
Kramer = Megan

[rachel brings up gay adoption]
i'm actually pretty glad I won't have to do pregnancy if ever I want a child. childbirth sounds just awful.
really? you don't feel like you're missing out? not even a little?
Because, to me, creating actual, breathing life out of just a little fluid and incubating it inside you sounds like just the most magical thing
No way. Pregnancy and especially childbirth really mess your body up, and you've got arrays of chemicals designed only to destroy the memories of it.
I think pregnancy is tough... but I feel it was worth it.

'...I'm sorry, but it wouldn't work. I'm... more interested in lesbians', Jess assumes she has a green light approach her
actually talking about a group project in queer studies class
girl is very apologetic about rejecting her. show heartbreak through imagery

From time to time I've taken breaks from society... And they might have taken a toll on my social skills...

E.Y.E. ideas:
every enemy has a semi random profile
-You killed a guy that was allergic to bananas.
"You killed a guy who really liked Journey"
11:18 Concordat: "You killed a guy who could spit 20 yards"
11:18 LumberjackBonanza: "You killed a guy who was actually kind of a prick. Good job."
you killed a father of five
"you killed a soccer player"
weapons with eccentric fire or secondary eccentric fire 
sentient weapons
invisible people
give every weapon/item/maybe power a backstory (as in drakenguard/NIER)
graffiti and other reading material

some text will be markov chain generated

profiles: (random choice of of the following)
-their sex
-a glint in their eye of a man/woman who x
-scar/bruise on body part x from y
-tatoo on body part x of y
-in their wallet you find x
-you count the rings on their body part x
-[under their uniform?] they wear a x
-in their x pocket/purse you find y
-hair style
-wear a style of clothes that says x
-jewerly/accessories
-socks
-shoes
-general category
Every now and then when you kill an enemy a ghost pops out and you can talk to it
They might choose to discuss one of their traits

tank enemies
other:

abilities:
slide/dash/warp (pass through only, still hurts if hurts)

percentage of damage shielded in inversely proportional to the amount of damage recieved (blocking against a flood of low damage particles is very effective)
shield is time limited
pickups size dependant on enemy strength

r=Math.random()+Math.random()+Math.random()/3; (Kate distribution)
r=Math.random()-Math.random()+Math.random()-Math.random(); r=r+((r<0.0) ? 4.0 : 0.0)/4; (Megan distribution)

attacking: (what about pickups, whelm delay + hitdelay + regen, hitboxes/attackboxes, attack, whelm, magic, and defense?)
jess has loads of whelm, can kick or punch, high defense, no whelm delay and small hitdelay but slow regen, mildly bigger pickups (no variance), wide attackboxes
kate has loads of magic, can only kick, low defense, long whelm delay but fast regen, somewhat bigger health pickups (low variance), small hitboxes, small attackboxes
megan has high attack, but little other, can only punch, long whelm hitdelay and exponential regen, somewhat bigger magic pickups (high variance), wide hitboxes
platforming:
jess has wide variance in speed, has double jump, umbrella, no skid, low airskid
kate is slow, can only castlevania jump, high gravity, quick jump canceling, can backflip, has upward jetpack (can't use to float?)
megan is fast, has high, floaty jumps, very slow jump canceling, high skid
traversal:
jess can swing and reel in hookshot, umbrella
kate has special blocks only she can stand on, can fit though small holes
megan can wall jump and climb up ledges, has superjump


damage formula:
level/2 + attack

Which one of you is the one who always tells the truth?
Are you the one who always tells the truth?
Does the door behind you have the treasure?
If I asked the person counter-clockwise to you what's behind your door, what would he say?
Is this puzzle the same each playthough, or is it randomized?
How many roads must a man walk down?

What kind of lame power is "heart," anyways?
"I no speek english!"

You resisted a hypnotic influence through only sheer willpower? I'm impressed.
"Only sheer willpower?" Is there another way?
To stage a mental override attack, the command needs to be understood by the language center.
The screwy nature of language makes this a weakness.
A typical solidier will attempt to mutate the command key to something benign.
But you ...

Megan-- you broke my brain!

Stacey- being a vampire is all main characters' fault. Asthmatic as human. kind of enjoys the power of being a vampire, dispite her 
vastly reduced lifespan. jokes about them looking tasty, etc to make them flinch

sucking a little blood won't harm the human. Sucking them dry will turn them into a vampire
Garlic drives vampires crazy and turns them violent (in a similar state just after transformation).
Water causes excrusiating pain. Sun's light forces them into bat form. Need permision to enter a house.
